## Project Description
Sudoku is a logic-filled puzzle game with the objective of filling a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9. Each row, column and 3x3 boxes can contain each number exactly once. As a logic puzzle, sudoku is an excellent brain game.

## Features
* A well crafted puzzle interface and controls made possible with Tailwind CSS.
* Automatically checking and flagging of input errors which do not conform to the sudoku rules.
* Automatic highlighting of cells related to the currently selected cell.
* Highlighting of similar numbers to the currently selected cell.
* Beautiful animation on completion of a row, column, box and the game.
* A timer with play and pause to record your speed in completing the game.
* A responsive interface which looks fluid in both PC and mobile.
* A number input pad.
* An undo and redo function.
* An erase function.
* A note taking function to mark cells with possible numbers.
* A hint function to reveal the correct answer for a cell if the games get too difficult.
* A function to restart the game or start a new game.
* Scripts to solve and generate sudoku puzzles.
* Over 500 puzzles to solve made possible with a sudoku generator.
  * The sudoku generator works by first randomly generating numbers across the board following the sudoku rules.
  * While in a continuous loop, a random cell is emptied.
  * The backtracking algorithm is then used to solve the puzzle.
  * If there is only 1 solution to the puzzle, a next random cell will be emptied.
  * If there is more than 1 solution, a new random cell will be chosen instead and the current cell will be filled back.
  * The loop will continue until no more cells could be emptied and there is only 1 solution to the puzzle.
